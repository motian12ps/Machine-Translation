honourable senators , what happened here , last Tuesday ? 
a selection committee was achievement . 
yesterday I attended on the first of this committee meeting . 
and I expected the committee admits that it does knew too independent senators what to do with the . 
what will not strike so much for a moment . 
the members of the selection committee can show some impact . 
on the business that a senator reshape over the next two years . 
it is a committee important , because , in principle , these nine to determine senators what committee sit some senators . 
my therefore introduced in the sitting of the committee to yesterday to realize that one of the nine not attend senators . 
it was sent a replacement . 
honourable senators name , I do person . 
you can see how now to i am friendly , ' t it ? 
the senators will have their own research who was on to find fault . 
when an individual accepts an work the , it must do . 
the women who are sitting in the Senate have proven . 
they remplissaient their duty much more that the majority of the men in the Senate . 
i remember as the sessions held that the to the committee of veterans in February 1998 . 
the Senate Ni or the House of Commons do not sitting at the time . 
three senators Liberals have sat in the proceedings of the committee , all of women . 
the officers of the Senate could not find a man to this committee . 
i could cite , word by word , what the hon. senator Carstairs took answered the question I asked . 
i asked him : " Quels were the criteria are as follows ? " 
it has said that it was the first to address the representation of women in a report . 
that it had on the drafted parliamentary associations in 1993 . 
Les delegations at the time formées were only of men . 
in that I remind that I have been replaced by Senator Finestone for a number of years . 
however , I look still re - enter the opportunity to my association preferred . 
honourable senators , I do not know how or when the House will be decision about these two reports . 
every time that the senators are on television verdict . 
wondered or by a group of students , to journalists or other . 
say that we do ? 
it is true , and I will believe . 
however , it should be bring in fact . 
i do not think in the replacing . 
if a senator accept this position in a committee , he or it should participate in all the meetings intended . 
we are not the members which we say in the corridors : 
" Présentez do you today and to committee , after two years of education , there is a vote final in committee '' . 
they do not even know what they are sang , but they viewed came to when their leaders sang to them . 
they do not know what has happened absolutely not . 
honourable senators , the words " continuité " and " dedication '' , come to the way in our speech . 
over the next two weeks , beginning to reflect on the way we will independent senators address the situation of the . 
if we do the are not , I créerai my own committee of Parliament who are interested in the world affairs . 
we are no one can gained . 
his Honour the Speaker : 
if any other hon. senator wishes to speak , do you is it the pleasure , honourable senators , to adopt the motion ? 
some hon. members : 
in agreement . 
( motions deemed adopted , the report and agreed to )
